# CryptoGrimoire
_A simple tool for monitoring currency and cryptocurrency prices on various exchanges_
___
### "What will this project be?"
With the help of this service, it will be possible to find out the current rates of trading pairs of different exchanges. Calculate where it is best to exchange one (crypto)currency for another.
<br>
<br>
Each trading pair will have its own page, which will display the average exchange rate, 24-hour rise / fall, trading volume, availability of input/output of currency from the exchange ... At the bottom of the page there will be a more detailed summary of this trading pair on various exchanges
<br>
<br>
A calculator will also be added, which will tell you where it is most profitable to exchange one pair currency for another. The calculation will be based on exchange orders, and not on the current buy / sell rate, which makes the calculator more accurate than the rest
___
For now, that's all. I will try to refine this project in the near future
